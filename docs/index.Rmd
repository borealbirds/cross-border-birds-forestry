title: Cross-border birds and forestry initiative 
subtitle: Challenges and opportunities for forestry to positively influence bird conservation
---

The Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) has funded the Boreal Avian Modelling Project (BAM) in collaboration with SFI and the American Bird Conservancy (ABC) to explore the relationship between SFI certified forest lands with forest bird populations. Specifically, we are working together to build knowledge of how SFI certified forests in the hemiboreal regions of eastern Canada and the United States benefit forest birds compared to non-certified forests.

To achieve our goal, we have brought together a great steering committee. This collaboration aims to improve our understanding of SFIâ€™s best management practices, as well as challenges and opportunities in managed forests in different regions with a diversity of governing bodies.
